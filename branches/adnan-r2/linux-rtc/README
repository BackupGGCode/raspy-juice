This newer patch for the PCF8523 RTC device driver was found already
submitted to the upstream linux-3.8-rc3. This entire  replacement from
the old one is adopted for backporting to linux-3.6 to make the
transition to linux-3.8 less painful. The instructions for patching
listed below remains the same.

The device driver registration in the board initialization of
arch/arm/mach-bcm2708/bcm270.c has also been fixed to recognise Rev.1 or
Rev.2 Raspberry Pi, where the I2C buses has been swapped.
