= Introduction =

Raspy Juice is an experimental expansion board to supply a Raspberry Pi (*RPi*) host computer with a regulated +5V from a wide-range voltage source. The board also contains a real-time clock, an RS232-level translator for the host console serial port, and an expansion AVR ATmega168A  microcontroller (MCU). This MCU provides the service of controlling 4 channels of RC servo outputs, an RS485 interface, and a half-duplex software-based RS232 interface. In addition, the spare pins of the MCU are brought to an expansion header which may be used for other purposes. The MCU itself is interfaced to the host computer through an I2C/TWI interface, in which the former is a slave device.

  * Atmel ATmega168A AVR microcontroller, running at +3.3V, 14.7456MHz and as a slave I2C device to the RPi host computer.
  * Secondary +3.3 450mA high-efficiency buck regulator
  * 4-channel RC servo port with JST connector
  * RS485 interface to USART0 of the AVR microcontroller.
  * RS232 interface to the programmable pins of the AVR microcontroller.
  * Expansion header of unused programmable pins of the microcontroller.

=== 2.1 RPi GPIO header ===
See description on http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals

Raspy Juice supplies the host Raspberry Pi with regulated +5V through this GPIO header using a 2A poly-resettable (PTC) fuse. *Warning: do not connect a +5V supply through the Raspberry Pi micro-USB connector when used with Raspy Juice.*

|| 2 || +VIN || 6 - 23V positive input, reverse-polarity protected. ||


=== 2.3 Console RS232 port and jack ===
The two connectors are wired in parallel and only one of these connectors may be used at any time. These ports provide for an RS232 level-translated of the Raspberry Pi console serial port signals (from the above GPIO header), to connect to a laptop, computer or other embedded devices.

=== 2.4 AVR RS232 port ===
From the expansion AVR microcontroller using a software-emulated UART, this port provides an RS232-level interface for connection to a computer, or other embedded devices. The transmission and reception of the data is through an application firmware service in the microcontroller, and the host Raspberry Pi interacts with the firmware service via the I2C interface of  the GPIO header.

=== 2.5 AVR RS485 port ===
From the expansion AVR microcontroller using the USART0, this port provides an RS485-level half-duplex interface for connection to other RS485-capable devices. No RS485 termination is provided at the PCB board level (ie., pullups/pulldowns/impedance-control) -- these may be configured at the last-mile connector. The transmission and reception of the data is through an application firmware service in the microcontroller, and the host Raspberry Pi interacts with the firmware service via the GPIO header I2C interface. The AVR pin PD4 controls the transmission-enable signal of the RS485 transceiver interface.

From the expansion AVR microcontroller PC[0..3] pins using TIMER1, these ports provide PWM signals of 1 - 2ms pulses, to connect to standard RC servos. The control of the individual PWM is through an application firmware service in the microcontroller, and the host Raspberry Pi interacts with the firmware service via the GPIO header I2C interface. A total of +5V 2A supplies these ports through a poly-resettable (PTC) fuse. Alternatively, these ports can be used to supply +5V to other external circuitry, or embedded devices.
